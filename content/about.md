Hello, I am Megh. I currently do some C++ and Rust and used to do a lot of Javascript previously.

I also love gamedev, Math and playing story-rich/puzzle games.

I studied Computer Science & Engineering at IIIT, Hyderabad.

You can contact me via my [site](https://meghprkh.github.io/) or my [github profile](https://github.com/meghprkh/)
