<a href=../../categories/opensource>Opensource</a></div><div><p>Hello everyone, I am participating in Google Summer Of Code 2016 under the GNOME project.</p><p>My project is related to an application called <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Games/>GNOME Games</a>. As you can see this app serves as an catalog of games alongside an emulator. My proposal is related to adding support for gamepads/joysticks/controllers to this app. By this I mean the ability to play emulated games using the gamepad.</p><p>This proposal has plans for adding support for remappabale controls and multiple gamepads (for multi-player games). This would come with an easy to use UI.</p><p>Also other stretch goals include the ability to control the &ldquo;Games UI&rdquo; itself using the gamepad as well as making the code reusable so that it can be used as a library. Some other stretch goals involve moving the gamepad configuration UI to control center as well as having gamepad support for the GNOME games pack itself (will start with Nibbles).</p><p>Looking forward to having a great summer wherein I will put my full potential into developing this ideas with the aid of my mentor <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/AdrienPlazas>Adrien Plazas</a>. I will regularly post updates here.</p></div><div class=tags>[ Tags:
