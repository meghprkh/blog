This means that soon you would be able to play your favorite retro games using a gamepad!
Currently you can plugin a gamepad and it will just work! The app will automatically detect it and allow you to play your favorite game using the gamepad. Support for playing multiplayer games is also there. The Games branch which supports gamepads can be found here.</description></item><item><title>Handling joysticks and gamepads in linux</title><link>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/handling-joysticks-and-gamepads-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 22:28:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/handling-joysticks-and-gamepads-in-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post I would share some of the things I came across when dealing with

we can reuse the community maintained controller mapping database that they have.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
