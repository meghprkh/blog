The Goal The goal to be achieved was to be able to play both single player and multiplayer emulated games using a gamepad in GNOME Games
Where are we right now Plug-n-play gamepad support: We use the SDL mappings format and thus reuse a huge community DB of mappings to provide this.</description></item><item><title>The state of gamepad support in Games</title><link>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/the-state-of-gamepad-support-in-games/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2016 01:32:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/the-state-of-gamepad-support-in-games/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gamepad support has now been merged into &lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Playground/Games">GNOME Games&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kekun/gnome-games/commit/c110c0390f40821779f2663bde50027b1f9f1acd">v3.21.4&lt;/a> !!!

Also I have created a playground for GTK which I use to create simple protoypes with some functionality. The really nice thing about Meson is its &lt;em>python-ish&lt;/em>/&lt;em>lua-ish&lt;/em> syntax. The other thing is that it is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> fast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GSoC - Progress so far</title><link>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/gsoc-progress-so-far/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 18:58:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/gsoc-progress-so-far/</guid><description>My project is about adding gamepad support to GNOME Games. This means that soon you would be able to play your favorite retro games using a gamepad!
Currently you can plugin a gamepad and it will just work! The app will automatically detect it and allow you to play your favorite game using the gamepad. Support for playing multiplayer games is also there. The Games branch which supports gamepads can be found here.</description></item><item><title>Handling joysticks and gamepads in linux</title><link>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/handling-joysticks-and-gamepads-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 22:28:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/handling-joysticks-and-gamepads-in-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post I would share some of the things I came across when dealing with
the handling of joysticks and gamepads in Linux. One of the goals I wanted to
achieve was to make our controller mappings compatible with the SDL ones so that
we can reuse the community maintained controller mapping database that they have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GSoC 2016: Introduction</title><link>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/gsoc-2016-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 17:49:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://meghprkh.github.io/blog/posts/gsoc-2016-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone, I am participating in Google Summer Of Code 2016 under the GNOME project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My project is related to an application called &lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Games/">GNOME Games&lt;/a>. As you can see this app serves as an catalog of games alongside an emulator. My proposal is related to adding support for gamepads/joysticks/controllers to this app. By this I mean the ability to play emulated games using the gamepad.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
